# Remote-Working-Survey-Analysis
#Overview:
This GitHub repository showcases an analysis of the "Remote Working Survey," which collected responses from 1,500 remote workers in New South Wales, Australia. The survey was conducted in August-September 2020 and March-April 2021, aiming to understand the evolving experiences and attitudes towards remote work during different stages of the COVID-19 pandemic.

#Project Description:
The project involves analyzing the survey data to gain insights into the impact of the pandemic on remote work, productivity, time management, and challenges faced. The repository provides details on the analysis methodology, tools used, key findings, and actionable recommendations.

#Project Goals:
1. Evaluate the changes in remote work patterns and attitudes during the COVID-19 pandemic.
2. Examine the impact of remote work on productivity and identify any associated benefits.
3. Compare time allocation between remote and on-site work.
4. Identify major barriers to remote work and suggest ways to address them.
   
#Tools Used: 
Power Query Editor: Cleaned and transformed the raw survey data for analysis.
Power BI: Visualized the data to present clear insights and trends.

#Key Findings:
1. Survey correspondents represented 19 industries, with significant participation in 2021 compared to 2020.
2. The top barriers to remote work were isolation, connectivity, motivation, IT equipment, and collaboration.
3. Challenges of working on-site while colleagues worked remotely included interruptions, poor collaboration, noise, connectivity, and difficulty innovating.
4. A substantial positive impact on productivity was observed, with over 3 million correspondents registering 50% or more productivity increase.
5. Approximately 50% of correspondents currently spend time working remotely compared to on-site.
6. The year 2021 witnessed a rapid increase in the percentage of work done remotely compared to 2020.

#Recommendations:
1. Implement initiatives to address the identified barriers to remote work, such as fostering collaboration and improving connectivity and motivation.
2. Recognize the positive impact of remote work on productivity and consider offering flexible work arrangements post-pandemic.
3. Provide resources and support to enhance remote work environments and reduce interruptions on-site.
4. Continue monitoring the evolving remote work trends to adapt policies and practices effectively.

#Contributions and Usage:
This repository serves as a demonstration of data analysis skills in Excel, Power BI, and data cleaning techniques. The analysis provides insights that can guide remote work policies, employee engagement strategies, and workplace improvements.
